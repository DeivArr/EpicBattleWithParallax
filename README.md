## Parallax battle made with Parallax.Js

In this case of study I´m going to show a technique to make a parallax scene made only with javascript, parallax js & the power of your fingers.

First, every image you see in the scene 1 have the same size Width and Height, however, some of this images doesn´t have a background, wich means that all this images are in the same scene without blocking each other. 

Second, every image has its own parallax parameters which means that every image moves at its own phase, creating a effect of dynamic movement through the whole scene.

And that´s it!

You can now create your own parallax scenes!.
Happy coding.
